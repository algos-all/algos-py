[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/all3fox/algos-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/all3fox/algos-py)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/all3fox/algos-py/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/all3fox/algos-py?branch=master)


## Motivation

Implement some CS algorithms and test them extensively. Code on the
master branch is expected to be correct. If not, please feel free to
submit and issue or a pull request.

## Testing

This repository uses `nose` for unit testing. Run from the root of the
project:

```
nosetests
```
To get an idea of test coverage, run:

```
nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=src
```
